### Guide of the task

1. Downloading Obsidian Software:
Obsidian is a powerful note-taking software that allows you to create, organize and connect your notes in a flexible way. To download Obsidian, follow these steps:

- Visit the Obsidian website: https://obsidian.md/
- Click on the "Download" button in the top right corner of the page.
- Select the appropriate download link for your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux).
- Follow the installation instructions to complete the setup process.

2. Reading the material
- Gets your books OR answered questions ready.

3. Finding Important Entities:
- When taking notes, it's important to identify the key entities in the material you're reading. This can help you understand the main ideas and connections between different pieces of information. Here are some strategies for finding important entities:
- Identify the main topic or theme of the material. This will help you focus on the most relevant information.
- Look for key terms, concepts, or ideas that are repeated or emphasized in the text.
- Identify any examples, evidence, or explanations that support the main argument or idea.
- Look for any connections or relationships between different pieces of information, such as cause-and-effect, similarities or differences, or chronological order.

4. Structuring Your Notes with Obsidian:
- Once you have identified the important entities in your reading material, it's time to start writing your notes. Here are some tips for structuring your notes with Obsidian:
- Create a new note for each entity. This will help you organize your notes and make it easier to find specific information later on.
- Use headings, bullet points, and other formatting tools to structure your notes. This will make it easier to read and understand your notes.
- Use tags to link related notes together. This can help you see connections and relationships between different pieces of information.
- Add links to external sources or related notes. This can help you access additional information or context for a particular entity.

By following these tips, you can create a comprehensive and structured set of notes using Obsidian. Happy note-taking!

### Inserting mathematical equations:
- To insert a mathematical equation into your Obsidian note, you can use LaTeX code surrounded by the $ symbol. For example, the code $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ will produce the equation a² + b² = c². You can also use the double $$ symbols to create a centered, standalone equation. For example:
$$\sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$
will produce the equation ∑(i=1 to n) i = n(n+1)/2.

Writing LaTeX code:
When writing LaTeX code for mathematical equations, it is important to follow the correct syntax and use the appropriate commands. Here are some commonly used LaTeX commands for mathematical equations:

Superscripts and subscripts: To add superscripts or subscripts, use the ^ and _ symbols respectively. For example, a^2 will produce a squared and x_0 will produce x subscript 0.
Fractions: To write fractions, use the \frac command. For example, \frac{a}{b} will produce a divided by b.
Roots: To write square roots, use the \sqrt command. For example, \sqrt{2} will produce the square root of 2.
Greek letters: To write Greek letters, use the appropriate command. For example, \alpha will produce alpha.
Summation and product symbols: To write summation and product symbols, use the \sum and \prod commands. For example, \sum_{i=1}^n i will produce the summation of i from 1 to n.

These are just a few examples of the many LaTeX commands available for writing mathematical equations. To learn more, you can refer to LaTeX documentation or online resources. More latex symbols: https://www.cmor-faculty.rice.edu/~heinken/latex/symbols.pdf
